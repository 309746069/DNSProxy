DNS proxy listens for incoming DNS requests on the local interface and resolves the hosts 
using an external PHP script, through http proxy requests. 

If you can't use VPN, UDP tunnels or other methods to resolve external names in your LAN, 
DNS proxy is a good and simple solution.


BUILD:

To compile the source code you need libCurl (with headers). 
For debian users simply install libcurl4-openssl-dev package. 

Usage: 
    dnsp -p 53 -l 127.0.0.1 -h 10.0.0.2 -r 8080 -s http://www.andreafabrizi.it/nslookup.php
    *Listen on port 53 (bind on 127.0.0.1) and sends the requests to external script over 10.0.0.2:8080 proxy

- Now using libCurl for http requests
- Implemented concurrent DNS server
